        <h1>What is "eSports"?</h1>
        <p>
            eSport, similar to regular sport, is a form of competition using video games.<br />
            Since video games exist, there was always the demand for multi-player games in which 2 people or more can play the same game together and experience the same events at the same time.<br />
            While multi-player games can make for a fun and casual time with your friends, eSports take it to a different level - in the way of competition.<br />

            Also similar to regular sports is the fact that there are a lot of eSports titles in different genres, which makes for a lot of variety - you will always find some sort of game you can have fun with (like sports!).<br />
            eSports started as a small thing, but in the modern times eSport tournaments can gather a lot of attention, competitors and prize-money, which bring teams and sponsers to step in and level up the competition.<br />
            Just to show how big eSports have become, here is a video of the grand finals in the League of Legends World Championship, taking place in a huge stadium.<br />

            Hopefully now you understand what does "eSport" means, so you can feel free to browse the site while understanding the concept of eSports.

        <p>
            My name is Ariel Lapidus, I'm 16 years old from Ness Ziona, Israel.<br />
            I mostly play fighting games, such as Super Smash Bros. Melee (in short: SSBM) and Street Figher III: 3rd Strike, which are considered more "retro" titles but I find them really fun even today, and of course they have a community of their own.<br />
            My "mains" (a term used to say the characters/roles someone mainly plays in a certain games) are Fox, Marth and Falco in SSBM and Chun-Li (a female character!) in 3rd Strike.<br />
            <img src="../Images/SSBM_Poster.jpg" alt="SSBM Poster" width="560" height="315" /><br />
            My favorite players are "Mang0" in SSBM and "MOV" in 3rd Strike, both which play characters that I use.<br />
            My favorite tournament set is Mang0 vs Leffen in Genesis 4, which had a really good drama going on (not to mention the games were insanely good).<br />

            I also play single-player games for fun, not all I play are eSport titles. Mostly games in the platforming genre.<br />
            Some of my favorite games are Sonic 3 & Knuckles, Celeste, Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Mario Kart 8.<br />

        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <p>
            This project is a school project since I'm in a cyber class.<br />
            We were asked to build a site in whatever subject we wanted, so I chose a subject that is close to me personally.<br />
            Right now, the site only contains static pages using HTML and CSS. In the next portion of the project, more stuff will be implemented!
