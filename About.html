        <h1>What is "eSports"?</h1>
        <p>
            eSport, similar to regular sport, is a form of competition using video games.<br />
            Since video games exist, there was always the demand for multi-player games in which 2 people or more can play the same game together and experience the same events at the same time.<br />
            While multi-player games can make for a fun and casual time with your friends, eSports take it to a different level - in the way of competition.<br />
            Also similar to regular sports is the fact that there are a lot of eSports titles in different genres, which makes for a lot of variety - you will always find some sort of game you can have fun with (like sports!).<br />
            eSports started as a small thing, but in the modern times eSport tournaments can gather a lot of attention, competitors and prize-money, which bring teams and sponsers to step in and level up the competition.<br />
            Hopefully now you understand what does "eSport" means, so you can feel free to browse the site while understanding the concept of eSports.
